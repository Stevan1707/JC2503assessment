                        then maybe a swim on weekends if I'm not lazy. 
                        Used to be a total gym rat though - like literally spent hours there. 
                        But since my card expired last semester, I just do dorm workouts now, such as
                        push-ups, resistance bands and training my strength with dumbbells. 
                        Actually way more chill than dragging myself to the gym!</p>

                            There, I can experience different food cultures and living habits, and also see 
                            different sceneries. The most crucial thing is that every time I go on a trip, I 
                            can enjoy a unique time with my best friends or family.</p>

                        <h2>Listening to music</h2>
                        <p class="evaluation">I do like relax myslef by listening to music. English pop music is of my favor.
                            Those famous songs form singer such as Ed Sheeran, Charlie Puth and Shawn Mendes can make me feel 
                            energetic for a whole day. When I fell stressed, I prefer to listening to songs in my song list.
                            Ed Sheeran's Perfect is one of my favorite songs. I love the song with romantic and slow ryythm.
